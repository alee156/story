Qi force is the energy of life. Different beings can use qi force to different effects.

Over 99.9% of humans are "mortals"

Mere humans on the bottom rung "mortals" can only use qi force to purchase goods.

Humans who are called the "gifted" can use qi force to strengthen their martial arts and to craft goods.

Higher order humans called "enlights" mastered their respective martial arts to become terrifying weapons of destruction.
Englights have tiers according to the zodiac.

Demon tier humans are capable of threatening entire cities of mortals single-handedly

There are only a dozen god tier humans who hold nations in balance


The "Three" are those who are able to the world.
- Gabriella: Death (Mark's childhood friend)
- David: Sloth + 7 sins (killed all the other sins)
"Do you know what true sloth entails? Working optimally so you can relax"
- Peter: Life (killed)
"Vermin must be kept in balance"

Council: Overlord (David)

The joker is rumored to be able to crush even the Three.
- Mark the savant: Controls light+shadows and is also the wielder of whimsy (extremely op debuffs and buffs based on luck) The reason he is undetected is because of the extreme debuffs he puts on himself.
========================================================================================

Mark: the joker, is a very pragmatic and logical man. His only aim to get married, financial independence, andd to lead an honest life free from stress and threats.
Suffers from anxiety+depression, hates working + studdying, and is too unconfident+nervous to interact with other people.
job: craftsman

Every time a God dies the three and the gods have a competition where they take their most qualified disciple to take
the quest to ascend to Godhood. But in this special case since Peter was killed, there is a spot in the Three. All the Gods and the Three are clamoring to maintain control over this tenuous balance of powers.


Storyline: Gabriella recruits Mark to serve as her God candidate's mentor. He refuses profusely to maintain his relative anonymity. Gabriella coaxes him into being the tank on the team who she assures will not receive any credit whatsoever. ("Do you remember who the tank was on David's party?") Begruddgingly with the promise of financial independence and access to Gabriella's network of female only disciples, David begins his journey to make his hero candidate the mmost powerful.

I can't remember the first Monday.

Wake up. Go to work. Drink Friday evening, stay in bed during the weekends playign videogames and binge watching TV shows.
Saving up money to spend on things that'll stop making me happy merely moments after I open them. Slowly watching friendships I thought would last forever dissolve with distance and time.
Is this all life has to offer?
